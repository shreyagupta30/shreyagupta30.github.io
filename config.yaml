    content: |-
      I am a software developer with expertise in Python, Django, Docker, postgreSQL and AWS/GCP. I've always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me.  I owe my career to FOSS community. Working on all these projects has helped me grow tremendously as a developer. I care about building impactful, accessible and inclusive tech for everyone. I care deeply about diversity and inclusion.ðŸ’œ

      As a developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work ethic in my day to day to make it impactful.
      When I'm not working, I love [curling up with a good book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83816379-shreya-gupta), [capturing beautiful moments with my camera](https://unsplash.com/@shreyagupta30). Recently, I've been trying my hand at urban sketching.
    
      I am currently a graduate student at Northeastern University, Boston, MA pursuing MS Information Systems.
