      I’m Shreya—a passionate software developer with a knack for solving real-world problems through technology. My journey started in the vibrant world of free and open source software, which not only shaped my technical skills but also instilled in me a deep commitment to diversity, inclusion, and community.
      
      At my core, I specialize in Python, Django, Docker, PostgreSQL, and cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. Every project I’ve worked on has been an opportunity to learn, grow, and make an impact. I thrive on challenges that push me to innovate, and my mission is to build impactful, accessible, and inclusive tech that truly makes a difference.

      When I'm at work, I pour my obsessive attention to detail and my love for crafting elegant solutions into every line of code. I leverage a diverse array of technologies and tools (including AI) to solve the problem at hand, ensuring that every solution is well-tested, clearly documented, and thoughtfully designed.

      Outside the codebase, I’m an avid reader and photographer. I love [curling up with a good book](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83816379-shreya-gupta) or [capturing beautiful moments with my camera](https://unsplash.com/@shreyagupta30). Recently, I’ve even been exploring urban sketching, adding a creative twist to my downtime.  

      Currently, I’m furthering my expertise as a graduate student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, pursuing an MS in Information Systems. Whether it's through learning or sharing, I’m always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow both personally and professionally.

      Feel free to reach out—I'm always excited to connect, collaborate, or just chat about all things tech!
